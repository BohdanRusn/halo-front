# This site has implemented almost everything using soket.io. But I don't have time to make the game itself on sockets.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You can create one game with one opponent. 

## Firstly you should add him to your friends.

You can chat after new game is created, but only chat.

### The game does not use sockets, so you have no connection with another player.
